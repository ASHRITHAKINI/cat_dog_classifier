# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

## Overview:
- Implemented an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- Utilized data science techniques in Python for model development.
- Trained the model on a dataset, achieving high accuracy.

## Project Details:
1. **Data Collection:** Used the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset available in the Fastai library.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Resized images to a uniform size of 224x224 pixels and split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. **Model Selection:** Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet34 architecture.
4. **Model Training:** Fine-tuned the pre-trained ResNet34 model on the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the trained model's performance using metrics such as error rate and confusion matrix.
6. **Model Deployment:** Provided an example of model deployment, allowing users to upload images and make predictions.
